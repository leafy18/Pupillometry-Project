# Pupillometry-Project
Analysis of pupil data from 45 participants collected during a patch foraging task.
Patch separation code, Baseline code and left right alignment codes for both reaction times and pupil data are common for all participants.
These codes can be replicated for other participants aswell.
Reaction time and pupil data Visualisation code can also be replicated for other participants depending on the data set that is being loaded.
